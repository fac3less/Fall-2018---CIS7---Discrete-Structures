Assignment #8
cis7-Discrete Structures

i enjoyed the first two videos of the series,it really explained the material covered in detail and clearly. At first i wasnt understanding
the concept of the topic in hand but afer watching the videos a few times it was finally understood. On the other hand though
the last few videos of the series, the material covered was only scratching the surface and wasnt going into depth. While it was
helpful at first, the series became irrelevant and found myself digging into alternate sources to better understand the material.
